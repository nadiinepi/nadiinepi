								<p>As a Gen Z illustrator, improving User Experience through design became a venture in adapting to the digital age of individual marketing. And as a hackathon enthusiast, I became passionate in product design even when starting out with no coding experience.</p>
								<p><b>I value innovation with a touch of minimalism.</b> I approach problems to communicate concepts in a simplistic yet effortless style.</p>
								<p>My current project Note was created to visualize a story in a short and digestable format. Note functions as a storyboard that is easily communicated and refined.</p>
								<p>I love a challenge. After a cup of coffee.</p>

								<h3>Project Context</h3>
								<p>A scene plays out in your mind. You take out your default notes app, you type in the hopes of describing it.
									But you know you can capture this scene more accurately, but there are no more words, and your drawing skills are subpar.
									You know when you revisit this long forgotten page, you would never understand the drawing, and the inspiration is incomplete.
								</p>
								<p><b>What is the most effective way to conceptualize inspiration?</b></p>
								<p>In the beginning stages of this project, I approached this question, revisiting a small annoyance I used to encounter when brainstorming: Why are there no apps that can support pictures with words?
									There may be the default notes app, but it relies on visual skill to convey this rough idea. Then is it one's fault that their drawing skills are not up to par?
								</p>
								<p>No. This reliance of writing to describe a scene also plays into the idea that one must have great skill in words to accurately describe this bout of inspiration. 
									And though one can still create with incomplete inspiration, it should not be the only choice one has.
								</p>
								<p>Note is an app that supports two forms of storytelling: words and pictures. But the pictures do not rely on sketching with a finger across a screen, but rather the use of 'digital stickers'
									that can visualize the concept more easily. 
								</p>
								<h3>Process; Initial Stages of Brainstorming</h3>
								<span class="image1"><img src="images/roughnote2.jpg" alt="first draft"  width="250" height="400" style="float: left; margin: 5px 20px 0 0;">
									<p>
										From the first draft, I started on the reader format, 
										where users would spend most of their time. Gathering the experience of a reader myself, I designed the reader format in a way that there was minimal movement of eye and finger scrolling. 
									</p>
									<p>
										Thus, the 'screen' where the digital stickers resided and the text that would break into small pieces would start at the middle of the screen.
									</p>
									<p>
										The rest of the brainstorming as seen was the designing of the digital stickers. I had to make sure that the details were simple yet had to express their reactions clearly.
										I settled on a square, using exaggerated body language for expression. Although starting with four types of body language, there would be more design as the project progresses.
									</p>
								</span>
								<span class="image2">
									<img src="images/roughnote.jpg" width="250" height="400" style="float: right; margin: 5px 5px 0 20px;">
									<p>
										The next draft of brainstorming was the first designs of the pages and functions the Note app would have. 
										I want users to have a community for support and seeking advice of an idea in the beginning stages. 
									</p>
									<p>
										The For You and Profile pages were essential, for a user to scroll through other 'notes' for inspiration and the user to have their page full of 'notes' of their own.
									</p>
									<p>
										I planned a loose algorithm for a user creating one 'note'. I had the most struggle with this, because I wanted to make sure that the creating of the 'note' would be easy, but pairing the digital stickers with blocks of text. 
										I also took note of the use of colour palette templates, where a user could customize their 'note' to an extent, ie. the background, text blocks and screen.
									</p>
								</span>
								<h3>Process; UI Design</h3>
								<span class="design1">
									<img src="images/X - 1.png" width="150" height="324.8" style="float:left; margin: 5px 30px 20px 15px;">
									<img src="images/X - 3.png" width="150" height="324.8" style="float:middle; margin: 5px 0 20px 0;">
									<img src="images/X - 9.png" width="150" height="324.8" style="float: right; margin: 5px 20px 20px 0;">
									<p>
										The first three designs by the use of Figma follow the profile page from the opening page. 
										As a first-time user, there would be an option to create a user profile but would not be a mandatory step if a user wanted to be a guest.
										In the profile page, there would be space for a profile picture, username and description. I also added space for a user's public statistics such as the number of 'notes', followers and reading lists. 
									</p>
									<p>
										The page would scroll down from the description, to the 'notes' and finally the reading lists.
										The icons that display the 'note' have a title with the cover so that one could have a general idea of the 'notes' displayed.
									</p>
									<p>
										As seen, there is a menu bar at the bottom for each separate page of the app: For You, List, Notifications, Profile and Create Note. 
										The Create Note button is more bigger and pronounced than the other pages to emphasize the idea to create as the main purpose of the Note app. 
										The icons themselves are minimal, but were drawn in rather than be a symmetrical icon to add more of a 'written' feel to the Note app.
									</p>
								</span>
								<span class="design2">
									<img src="images/X - 2.png" width="150" height="324.8" style="float:left; margin: 5px 30px 20px 15px;">
									<img src="images/X - 5.png" width="150" height="324.8" style="float: main; margin: 5px 0 20px 0;">
									<img src="images/X - 4.png" width="150" height="324.8" style="float: right; margin: 5px 20px 20px 0;">
									<p>
										The For You page, directed from the home icon, allows the user to search or look through new notes by feature or genre. 
										The Featured Notes are at the top, where the 'notes' are lined up and scrolling sideways would display more featured 'notes'. 
										The selection would change daily, so the user could check in every day for a new bout of inspiration.
										I really like the display of the genre selection, having the covers and name for each genre tilted, to just give a different edge of this page compared to the others.
									</p>
									<p>
										The next page shows the results from a search, with the title separated from the cover for more clarity while searching. 
										This decision was made because I had to take into account titles that were long in length and thus would not be clearly displayed in the cover.
									</p>
									<p>
										For the main page of the 'note' itself, I brought more focus to the 'chapters' of the 'note' over the description because I wanted the user to start reading the 'note' right away.
										Another reason was because as the 'note' is a rough visualization of a concept, a description would not be a complete representation of the 'note' itself.
									</p>
									<p>
										I also added four icons at the top: Like, Comment, List and Profile. This adds to the community aspect of the Note app that allows the user 
										the option to save, like and comment the 'note', and by extension, user profiles. 
									</p>
								</span>
								<span class="design3">
									<img src="images/X - 7.png" width="150" height="324.8" style="float:right; margin: 5px 5px 0 30px;">
									<p>
										The reader view was a page that was both easy and difficult. From the first draft, I had already decided that the screen and texts were from the middle; 
										but as I started designing, I had to decide whether the 'screen' was at the dead center or slightly below. 
										This placement would affect the overall page in terms of the space provided for the text would be too small, creating a cluttered top half that contrasted with an empty bottom half. 
									</p>
									<p>
										I finally decided that the screen would be off-center, so that there could be more space for the text and lessen the space at the bottom half. 
										I also placed the menu hidden, only seen by scrolling up from the horizontal line at the bottom. This is so the attention is focused on the content, but the user is able to leave easily. 
									</p>
									<p>
										This project is a work in progress, as the editor function and few pages are not designed at the moment- but hopefully after the design process, this app can be coded!

										This project focused on answering questions a normal person would have concerning law and the legal system. 
										Legal Bearing is a website that is based on the interaction between users with questions and qualified users to answer them.
									</p>
									<p>
										This website has two separate pathways to distinguish the two users; and thus a mirroring effect is used for the pages in contrasting colour.
										Another choice I've made is the 'post' sharing the same colour, as it shares the same data in both views. 
									</p>
									<p>
										Another page to highlight is the user profile. More specficially, the profile of the legal professional user. 
										The tag 'lawyer' is a small detail that classifies that this user is a qualified lawyer.
										Notice how the word 'icon' is used instead of 'picture' - It is an aspect of this website is that it provides anonymity.

									<h3>Waterloop Sponsor Page ( Feb 2020 )</h3>
									<img src="images/Frame 14.jpg" width="200" height="600" style="float: left; margin: 5px 20px 0 0 ">
									<p>
										I was a part of Waterloop's web development and design team that focused on maintaining and creating the website of Waterloop.
									</p>
									<p>
										The sponsor page I designed was an important task because not only showcased the sponsors, but also promoted the design team.
										A difficulty I encountered was the attempt to display the many sponsors without the user itself losing interest throughout the page. 
									</p>
									<p>
										By creating an illustration in the background that acts as a silhouette of a trail, the user can follow seamlessly down the sponsor list. 
										This simple detail is effective in creating a flow that directs individual attention to each sponsor for the user. 
									</p>
									<p>
										I also made sure that the colours were the same so as to create a uniform look throughout the page, and additionally allow the sponsors to pop out of the dark blue.
